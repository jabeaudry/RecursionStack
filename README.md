# RecursionStack

For a given starting index and an array that ends with the integer 0, the algorithm works as such:

It begins at the starting index. The value is read and the algorithm jumps both right and left by the said value. At the new indexes, the steps are repeated. The algorithms returns true if there is a path that can reach the final index of 0. 

There are two versions of the algorithm. The first relies on recursion, the second iteratively uses the Stack ADT.
